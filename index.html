        <p class="indent">
            Hi, I'm Hari - a computer enthusiast living in India who gets excited about bringing imagination into software. 
            I enjoy building things from scratch and watching them evolve. 
            <br>I have experience in working on personal projects (building CLI tools and front end development). 
            I'm eagerly looking for opportunities to tackle real-world challenges and gain insights.

                Other than coding, I like to tinker around in Linux,
                trying out new software from time to time.
                Outside of the computer world, I often read books in my free time,
                watch interesting movies and series,
                always capture moments around me with my phone and edit them,
                occasionally sketch, 
                cook when necessity comes
                and hang out with my dear friends now and then.

                    A tui-based puzzle game where the player sort a shuffled numbered matrix by
                    sliding tiles into correct positions. Features multiple difficulty levels 
                    and leaderboard functionality to track solving performance. 
                    This project was a fun experiment in employing various concepts
                    that i learned in DSA classes from college and testing my basic knowledge on
                    building simple string parsers, and in learning the ncurses library.

        <b>HISTORY</b>
        <p class="indent">
            I've been curious about the magic box from a very young age.
            I spent a lot of time playing games and editing photos to make them look better.
            This led me to try Blender (though I never got very good at it) and eventually to programming.
            I fell in love with solving problems through code when I was around 17.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="indent">
            During the covid 19 pandemic, I finished high school but was stuck in a box with no friends around.
            That's when I discovered Linux, a new friend.
            After some hesitation, I gave it a try and it showed my old potato laptop a new life.
            This is where my real journey started.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="indent">
            I began with C programming and learned the basics. 
            I explored front-end development and UI design, then tried Rust but found it too difficult.
            So I went back to C to strengthen my roots.
            I built some small projects, learned about memory management and working with strings,
            and created a structure for future projects.
            I made a simple puzzle game and an SVG image generator using
            what I grasped about parsing and string manipulation.
            Now I am excited about the obstracles along the way.
            I'm planning to rewrite everything in rust though :^)
        </p>

    <section>
        <b>ABOUT</b>
        <p class="indent">
            I was tired of seeing all the UI clutter when all I wanted to do is read.
            So I thought it would be a good idea to write an "about me" page in plain text.
            I've tried a style in figma but it wasn't that interesting.
            Then the idea of writing in the style of linux man-pages poped on to my mind.
            hope you liked it and have a great day.
